      <h2>Biography</h2>
    </div>
    <div class="column three-quarters-col content-block">
      <p>
        Being a Grand Rapids native, I am a bit biased when I say that Grand Rapids
        is a wonderful place to live! The combination of small-town feel and big-city
        opportunity is hard to beat. Since I have been born and raised in this
        wonderful city, I know about many of the small treasures that Grand Rapids
        has to offer--including the city's best new restaurants and greatest coffee
        shops. And of course, being a Realtor, I pride myself in knowing all about
        the neighborhoods in Grand Rapids and surrounding areas.
      </p>
      <br>
      <p>
        I grew up in a family that was very involved in the real estate industry.
        Because of this, real estate has been an interest and passion of mine for
        as long as I can remember. I absolutely love my job, and I've been told
        that my passion shines through in all of my real estate endeavors.
      </p>
      <br>
      <p>
        My goal is to make your real estate journey as seamless and hassle-free
        as possible. Whether you're looking to buy, sell, build, or invest in
        property, I'm here to help your dreams become a reality. From the beginning
        until the end, I will be in constant communication with you, and be by your
        side every step of the way (through closing and beyond). I will listen to
        your story, and create a plan that best meets your desires. Whether you're
        a young couple looking for your first home, or a seasoned real estate
        investor, my goal is to meet your own personal needs and unique situation.
      </p>
      <br>
      <p>
        As your real estate agent, you gain access to my vast network of service
        providers. You can expect promptness, honesty, integrity, and superb
        communication from me throughout the entire process. In addition, with my
        strong yet fair negotiation style, my clients feel very well-served.
      </p>
      <br>
      <p>
        If you're looking for a Realtor who can help you reach your real estate
        goals, I would love to hear from you and get an idea of how my services
        can best fit your needs!
